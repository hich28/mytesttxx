  /// \brief Degeneralize a spot::tgba into an equivalent sba with
  /// only one acceptance condition.
  ///
  /// This algorithms will build a new explicit automaton that has
  /// at most (N+1) times the number of states of the original automaton.
  ///
  /// When \a use_z_lvl is set, the level of the degeneralized
  /// automaton is reset everytime an SCC is exited.  If \a
  /// use_cust_acc_orders is set, the degeneralization will compute a
  /// custom acceptance order for each SCC (this option is disabled by
  /// default because our benchmarks show that it usually does more
  /// harm than good).  If \a use_lvl_cache is set, everytime an SCC
  /// is entered on a state that as already been associated to some
  /// level elsewhere, reuse that level (set it to 2 to keep the
  /// smallest number, 3 to keep the largest level, and 1 to keep the
  /// first level found). If \a ignaccsl is set, we do not directly
  /// jump to the accepting level if the entering state has an
  /// accepting self-loop.
  ///
  /// Any of these three options will cause the SCCs of the automaton
  /// \a a to be computed prior to its actual degeneralization.
  ///
  /// The degeneralize_tba() variant produce a degeneralized automaton
  /// with transition-based acceptance.
